- Current program -
Here is the current program we are trying to improve (you will need to propose a modification to it below).

{current_program_content}

- SEARCH/REPLACE block rules -

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE


Make sure that the changes you propose are consistent with each other. 
For example, if you refer to a new config variable somewhere, you should also propose a change to add that variable.

- Task -
Suggest a new idea to improve the code that is inspired by your expert knowledge of optimization and machine learning.

Describe each change with a SEARCH/REPLACE block.

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program. Focus on changing the code in EVOLVE-BLOCK.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.
