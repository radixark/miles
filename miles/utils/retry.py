"""Generic bounded retry with exponential jittered backoff.

A small synchronous counterpart to the async retry loop in
``miles/utils/http_utils._post``. The caller supplies a ``should_retry``
predicate so the retry policy stays decoupled from *what* counts as
retryable — this module is not tied to any backend (HTTP, Ray, ...).

    ``thunk`` must be safe to re-invoke on a retried failure — wrap an
    idempotent operation (e.g. a ``ray.get`` on already-submitted object refs),
    not a non-idempotent side effect.

    ``should_retry(exc)`` decides whether a raised ``Exception`` is retryable;
    anything it rejects propagates immediately (so genuine errors are never
    masked), and the last retryable error is re-raised once ``max_retries``
    attempts — the first call included — are exhausted (so a persistent
    failure fails fast rather than hanging). ``BaseException``s that are not
    ``Exception``s (``KeyboardInterrupt``, ``SystemExit``) are never
    intercepted. Backoff is exponential with an additive 0-1s jitter: the
    deterministic floor preserves a minimum recovery window, the jitter
    de-synchronizes concurrent callers.
