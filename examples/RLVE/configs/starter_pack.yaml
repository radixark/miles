# RLVE Starter Pack Configuration
# =================================
# Uses RLVE's identifier2environment registry directly.
# Prompts are generated on-the-fly (not pre-generated) to enable curriculum learning.
#
# Environment weights determine sampling probability. Higher weight = more samples.
# kwargs are passed to env.generator(parameter=kwargs) for problem generation.
# Parameter names follow RLVE env definitions (some use N, others MAX_M_N/MAX_N_M).

environments:
  # Core math environments (RLVE's vetted base set)
  Multiplication:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      digit_num: 3  # 3-digit multiplication problems

  Division:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      divisor_digit_num: 2
      answer_digit_num: 2

  Sorting:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      N: 10  # Array length (NOT MAX_M_N)

  EuclidGame:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      MAX_X_Y: 100  # Max value for X and Y

  # Additional variety environments (lower weight)
  ShortestPath:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      N: 6  # Graph size
      edge_density: 0.3

  SpiralMatrix:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      MAX_M_N: 5  # Matrix dimension

  LightUpPuzzle:
    weight: 1.0
    kwargs:
      MAX_N_M: 5  # Puzzle dimension
      density: 0.3  # Fraction of black cells with numbers

# Answer format markers
# Model must wrap final answer with these tags for verifier to extract
answer_markers:
  start: "<answer>"
  end: "</answer>"

# Format reward bonus coefficient (matches RLVE's tinker integration)
# total_reward = base_reward + format_coef * format_score
# Set > 0 to reward correct answer formatting even when answer is wrong
format_coef: 0.0

# Curriculum learning settings (Phase 2)
# When use_controllers is true, environments use RLVE's difficulty controllers
# to progressively increase problem difficulty based on success rate.
use_controllers: false

# Starting difficulty level for all environments (0 = easiest)
initial_difficulty: 0

# Number of recent difficulty levels to sample from (sliding window)
# e.g., if max_difficulty=5 and window=2, samples from difficulties 4 and 5
difficulty_sliding_window_size: 1

# Accuracy threshold to advance difficulty (when use_controllers: true)
min_metric_to_increase_difficulty: 0.5

# Minimum prompts before checking if difficulty should advance
# Threshold = min_prompts_before_difficulty_check * n_samples_per_prompt
min_prompts_before_difficulty_check: 8
